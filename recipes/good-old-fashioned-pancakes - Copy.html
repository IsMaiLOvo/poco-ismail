        <li>In a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs with melted butter. Press onto bottom of springform pan.
            </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix cream cheese with sugar until smooth. Blend in milk, and then mix in the eggs one at a time, mixing just enough to incorporate. Mix in sour cream, vanilla and flour until smooth. Pour filling into prepared crust.</li>
